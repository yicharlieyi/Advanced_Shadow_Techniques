#  CSC 562 Course Project - Advanced Shadow Techniques

## Project Description
This project implements real-time shadow mapping techniques in WebGL, including basic shadow maps, Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF), and Cascaded Shadow Maps (CSM) with a configurable number of cascades. The interactive UI allows users to toggle shadow modes, adjust cascade parameters, and control light position. The system demonstrates advanced shadow rendering for dynamic 3D scenes.

## Directions: How to Run the Code
1. Download or clone the repository.

2. Open index.html with Live Server (Live Server extension required).

3. Use the on-screen UI panel to select shadow techniques, adjust cascade count/size, kernel siz/bias size for PCF, and move the light source.

4. Use arrow keys or WASD to navigate around the scene.

## Extra Credits
1. Attempted component 5: User Interface: develop a graphical interface that allows users to dynamically adjust shadow parameters (e.g., light position, bias value, cascade counts) in real-time. Additional Shadow Metrics and Statistics: Display real-time performance statistics, such as: Frame rate (FPS), Rendering times for each shadow technique.

## Assets
All textures used are stored in the textures folder.
